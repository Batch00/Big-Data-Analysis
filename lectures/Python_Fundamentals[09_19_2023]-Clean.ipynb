    "In Python, a user-defined function is a custom function created by the programmer to perform a specific task or set of tasks. User-defined functions are essential for organizing code, making it more modular, and promoting code reuse. These functions can be defined and used throughout your program to encapsulate logic and improve code readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "To define a user-defined function in Python, you typically use the `def` keyword followed by the function name, a pair of parentheses containing any parameters the function takes, and a colon to indicate the start of the function's code block. Here's a basic syntax example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def function_name(parameter1, parameter2, ...):\n",
    "    # Function code goes here\n",
    "    # This code block is indented\n",
    "    # You can include one or more statements\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage of the function\n",
    "result = function_name(argument1, argument2, ...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The components of a user-defined function are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Function Name**: This is the name you give to your function. It should be descriptive of the function's purpose and follow Python naming conventions (e.g., using lowercase letters with underscores for multi-word function names).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Parameters**: Parameters are placeholders for values that the function expects to receive when it is called. They are defined within the parentheses and act as input to the function. Functions can have zero or more parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Function Code**: The function code block contains the statements that define what the function does. It is indented to indicate that it is part of the function definition. You can include any valid Python code within the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Function Call**: To use the function, you call it by its name and provide actual values (arguments) for the parameters. The function is executed with these arguments, and it can return a result or perform some action.\n",

It is widely used in data science, data analysis, and data manipulation tasks. Pandas is built on top of the NumPy library and provides easy-to-use data structures such as Series and DataFrame, which are designed to handle and manipulate data efficiently.`pandas` is well suited for many different kinds of data:\n",

The parameter names of `DataFrame()` are used as the column names in the data frame and the parameter data are the variables of the data frame (columns).\n",
