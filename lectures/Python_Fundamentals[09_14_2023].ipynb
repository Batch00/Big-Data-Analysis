    "# Python fundamentals for Thursday, September 14\n",
    "\n",
    "This course will focus on data analysis techniques for working with data. It is not, by any definition, a programming course. Instead it is a course that will utilize programming to achieve a particular goal. En route to that goal we will need to equip you with some basic working knowledge of Python. Though some of you may already be well-versed in this programming language, this is not expected or required to enroll in this course. In this module we will cover the most basic building blocks of Python programming to help facilitate the much more interesting analytical work to come. We need not be fluent in Python to move forward. In fact, the concepts introduced in these introductory sessions will be more than sufficient preparation to charge on into the exciting world of Big Data analysis.   \n",

    "4. Loops\n",

    "Follow along as we work our way through this document. Use the code cells to test and experiment as we go. Try to complete all of the practice exercises and ask questions if you need assistance. "

Doing so opens a menu with suggestions. Hit Enter to choose the suggestion. In addition, Jupyter Notebook has another easy way to get help about an object - simply add a question mark to the alias."
